                        <p>Network Security can involve both hardware and security that is designed to ensure that safety of threats that can either enter your network, or spreading on your network.</p>

                          <!-- Insert video here -->
                            <p>Securing your Network can be done in a few different ways, using different wireless protocols, strengthening passwords, securing ports for different devices such as Printers to
                              stop them from being hijacked like <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46552339">this example</a> in 2018.</p>
                            <h3>What should I do to protect my Network?</h3>
                              <dl>
                                <dt>Change your Wireless Protocol to WPA2</dt>
                                  <dd>WPA2 is currently the most secure Wireless Protocol that is available. With this you'll be able to enable two different types of encryption: TKIP - Temporal Key
                                    Integrity Protocol & AES - Advanced Encryption System. AES is the more secure of the two due to it's long encryption keys, and it's also faster than TKIP making it
                                    redundant. This can be done through your Browser at address 192.168.0.1 - if this does not work, consult your device's manual.</dd>
                                    <dt>Change your Wireless Password</dt>
                                      <dd>Whilst your Wireless Password may look strong, it can be made stronger - one example of this comes from Virgin Media's SuperHubs their default passwords do not
                                        contain symbols as a part of their password, they consist of uppercase and lowercase letters, and numbers. More information on password integrity can be found
                                        <a href="passwordtips.html">here</a>.</dd>
                                        <dt>Change your Router's Password</dt>
                                          <dd>With most router's the passwords that they provide for the Router itself is extremely simple, once again using the Virgin Media Super Hub as an example the
                                            username and password that they provide is 'Admin' & 'changeme'. Doing this makes sure that should someone have breached your network they will not have
                                            control of the <b>whole</b> network. Comparably this would be like having your E-mail account breached, the attacker would have access to all of your different
                                            services, and from there could potentially control everything that is happening on them, or steal data from them.</dd>
                                            <dt>Secure Physical Ports</dt>
                                              <dd>Ensure that Physical Ports can not be connected too easily, this is done more easily in a home environment and can be a more costly process in a business
                                                environment, should it require the need for a security infrastructure overhaul such as changing locks, securing trunking, and monitoring physical access.</dd>
