                          <p>Aircrack is a network software suite that is used in to test Wi-Fi network security -
                             however it can be used to allow outside users to gain access to a network.  From there
                              an outside user would be able to gain access to a lot of information, as well leaving
                               network users exposed.</p>
                    </header>
                    <section>
                        <h2>How are these conducted?</h2>
                          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wQ_kf-ot-O0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                            <p>Man in the Middle attacks have changed drastically as new, and more advanced
                               technologies have been developed. Most recently in the news a technique known
                                as TLS Tapping has been widespread across the Internet. The process includes
                                 software such as Anti-Virus, Web Development Tools, or Malware which will
                                  replace the certificates for different reasons, i.e. Scanning for Malware,
                                   Debugging, or just malicious intent respectively.</p>
                              <p>However not all MITM attacks are conducted in this manner, some include physically
                                 being closer to the Network to gain access to the Information that is on said Network.
                                  From this, it is highly advised that all users should have high security passwords
                                   on all Network Devices, to stop the potential breach, and interception of data
                                    on the Network. </p>
                          <h2>How can I protect myself?</h2>
                            <p>There are several different ways to protect yourself from Man in the Middle attacks, these are as follows:</p>
                            <dl>
                              <dt><b>Be Safe</b></dt>
                                <dd>Since you may not know when these attacks are happening, the best preventative
                                  measure is to be cautious, don’t use unsecured public Wi-Fi connections, don’t
                                  purchase goods on a mobile connection. These connections can be hijacked -
                                  only use Wireless connections that you trust such as a protected Home network, or
                                  a protected Private network.</dd>
                              <dt><b>Be Secure</b></dt>
                                <dd>Should a HTTPS certificate be untampered, all traffic between you and the server
                                   is encrypted. This means that any information that is in the packets cannot be seen
                                    through plain text whereas HTTP packets can be read, and private information can be seen (More information on
                                    Phishing links <a href="phishingprotect.html">here</a>).</dd>
                              <dt><b>Be Vigilant</b></dt>
                                <dd>Make sure that all devices are up to date with latest updates – these will heighten security
                                  standards that the device has. Ensure that home networks are protected with high strength passwords
                                  – more information about these can be found <a href="passwordtips.html">here</a>. Should it be required, an Intrusion Prevention System
                                  can be acquired to make sure that threats cannot breach your Network.</dd>
